**Question 1**: Based on the database images, give a brief explanation of the data structure (you can instert a diagram)


**Question 2**: Why pick a NoSQL for nagimo?
Amy's Answer: NoSQL is beneficial to use for Nagimo because it is easily adapable, and as the company/codebase grows, it will be useful to have a database that can easily update with new situations. NoSQL is adaptable because: 
    - Data can be stored in an unstructured format.
    - The database can be scaled inexpensively, by using the cloud and through horizontal/distributed scaling (multiple servers storing information).

As users begin using Nagimo, the Nagimo team may come across use cases and new required data to be stored that they hadn't seen before. With NoSQL, we can add this information to the database easily, without having to delete and recreate data structure. NoSQL is advantageous for new programs/companies that are continuing to get familiar with the market space and what is needed by customers, and may need adapt in the future.

Using a distributed database on the cloud is also advantageous for startups like Nagimo because it is a less costly and provides the team with the option to scale quickly. With the expectation that the user base may grow quickly/virally, Nagimo needs to be able to quickly add users and obtain more storage space and computing power if needed. This can be done much more easily with distributed databases, because you can quickly have access to more compute power by incoporating more nodes to do the work in your network/system. Meanwhile with a non-distributed/vertically-scaled database, it takes more time and effort to add more storage and compute power to the database. Nagimo expects to be storing large amounts of data in the future, so it is more advantageous to go for a distrubted, horizontally scaled database.
